# Dynamic module loading

## Introduction
Features such as the graphics schema support a number of potential modules that may be required.  
The last thing you want to do is load all modules just in case you may need it.  
To solve that problem we use crs-modules and register modules with crs-modules that will load them as we need them.

This means that you can define a map of all potential modules but only load those you need as you need them.
The convention we use here is to make the class we want to use the key of the module.

For example:
```js
await crs.modules.add("MeshBasicMaterial", `${url}materials/MeshBasicMaterial.js`);
```

You can add your own modules to the loader using the same code above.  
Thus if you want to add a threejs material not by default registered with the loader, just add it.
The first parameter is the material class name, and the second where to find the file that exposes that class.
