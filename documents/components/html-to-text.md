# html-to-text
This component allows you to show html content in your document as text content so that you can safely display code on your page without it affecting the page's content.
The HTML content to load is in an external HTML file.
This makes it easier to reuse code snippets throughout different parts of your application or documentation.

```html
<html-to-text src="/templates/html-example.html"></html-to-text>
```
