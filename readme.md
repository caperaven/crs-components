# CRS Components
## Introduction

This is a component library for crs applications
## Requirements

This component library has some dependencies.
[crs-binding](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding) is assumed to exist in the project.  
You will need to install and load crs-binding in your project during startup.
In some cases like "monaco", requirejs is needed to handle amd modules.  
Requirejs is packaged with this library, so you don't need to install it.
